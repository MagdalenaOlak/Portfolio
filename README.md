# About me
My name is Magdalena Olak. I discovered the profession of tester relatively recently - it was love at first sight. Since then I have completed 3 online courses and I have started postgraduate studies in the field of Software Tester. I am convinced that I will quickly get into work in this position, because during the last 9 years I have been dealing with creating and testing websites using, among others Jira, TestLink, GIT, HTTP, CSS, PHP and CMS. I know the basics of SQL / MySQL also. I see the employment as a software tester as a milestone in my professional career thanks to the variety of tasks and the possibility of development. My goal is to develop testing knowlage and technical skills. On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches.
