## About me
My name is Magdalena Olak. I discovered the profession of tester relatively recently and I liked it very much. I knew right away that I could quickly be very good at it because during the last 9 years I have been dealing with creating and testing websites using, among others, Jira, TestLink, GIT, HTTP, CSS, PHP and CMS. I also know the basics of SQL / MySQL. Last year I have completed 3 online courses and I have started postgraduate studies in the field of Software Tester. I have set my daily routine on the priority of learning as much as I can in the field of testing. I see the employment as a software tester as a milestone in my professional career thanks to the variety of tasks and the possibility of development. I'm oriented for further development as Software Tester/Software Test Engineer. On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches.
